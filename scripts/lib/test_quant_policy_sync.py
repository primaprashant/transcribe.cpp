"""Pin the converter-side quant bucketing against the canonical policy.

There are three hand-maintained copies of "what bucket does tensor X belong
to" in this repo:

  1. tools/transcribe-quantize/policy.cpp::classify_tensor  — CANONICAL.
     The C++ quantizer's per-tensor bucket table (Norm / Conv / ConvPw /
     Linear / Embed). It is the source of truth and mirrors the loader's
     dtype allowlist (src/transcribe-weights-util.h).
  2. scripts/lib/gguf_common.py::reference_dtype_for         — this test.
     The Python helper every converter uses to pick a per-tensor dtype when
     emitting a reference-tier (F32/F16/BF16) GGUF. It re-implements a SUBSET
     of (1): it only needs the Norm (-> F32) and Conv (-> F16 when the
     reference dtype is BF16, which the loader has no conv kernel for) rules,
     because at the reference dtype every other tensor just keeps that dtype.
  3. scripts/convert-funasr_nano.py::per_tensor_target_dtype — a family-local
     fork of (2). Not exercised here (importing it pulls torch); documented in
     that file. If it ever folds back into the shared helper, delete it.

Copies (1) and (2) carry "keep in sync" comments but nothing enforced them.
This module is that enforcement, for the Python copy: it locks the dtype
`reference_dtype_for` assigns to a representative tensor from every bucket and
every family-specific override, so the helper cannot silently regress or drift
further from policy.cpp. The name lists below are a transcription of
policy.cpp::classify_tensor — keep them in sync with that file (now there is a
single, *tested* transcription instead of a silent second implementation).

It is intentionally NOT a cross-process check against the C++ binary: that
would need a built transcribe-quantize and the multi-GB reference GGUFs, which
do not belong in a fast unit test. The canonical buckets are transcribed here
as data and reviewed against policy.cpp.

#
# NOTE on pointwise: policy.cpp::classify_tensor decides the pointwise bucket
# from the stored shape, not the name — [1, in, out] (ne0 == 1) is ConvPw/F16
# because no block quant has a 1-element row, while a 2-D [in, out] pointwise
# is an ordinary mul_mat operand and lands in Linear. reference_dtype_for has
# no shape argument, so it keeps the name-based Conv answer for BOTH layouts.

# a Linear too, and the loader's linear allowlist accepts it. The split only

# KNOWN DRIFT — policy.cpp::classify_tensor places these in the Norm (F32) or
# Conv (F16) bucket, but reference_dtype_for does NOT implement the matching
# rule, so it currently returns the reference dtype unchanged.
#
# This is SAFE today only because every family that emits one of these names
# either:
#   (a) converts at F32 reference, where reference_dtype_for is a no-op
#       (sensevoice: cmvn/after_norm/tp_norm/enc.embed; canary: norm{1,2,3}/
#       dec.norm; moonshine-streaming as shipped: enc.embedder.comp.log_k),
#   (b) special-cases the tensor to F32 in its own converter, bypassing this
#       helper (voxtral-realtime: dec.time_embed.inv_freq, emitted F32), or
#   (c) uses a family-local converter that does not call this helper at all
#       (granite_nar: conv_bn.*, prj.*, conv_pointwise/conv_depthwise).
#
# Pinned here so the gap is visible and locked. If a BF16/F16-reference family
# ever emits one of these names through reference_dtype_for, the helper will
# silently mis-store the tensor (e.g. a norm at BF16 where the loader wants
# F32). The fix is to add the rule to reference_dtype_for and MOVE the name
# into NORM / CONV above — this test will fail (the name no longer returns the
# reference dtype) until you do, which is the intended tripwire.
