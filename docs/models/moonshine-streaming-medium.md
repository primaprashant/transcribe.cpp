# Moonshine Streaming Medium

<!-- catalog:intro -->
Upstream: [`UsefulSensors/moonshine-streaming-medium`](https://huggingface.co/UsefulSensors/moonshine-streaming-medium) at [`57b8436`](https://huggingface.co/UsefulSensors/moonshine-streaming-medium/commit/57b8436).

English speech-to-text in both one-shot and streaming modes. An encoder-decoder
ASR model designed for streaming use (ergodic encoder + sliding-window
attention, 50 Hz time-domain frontend). Same family as moonshine-streaming-tiny
and moonshine-streaming-small; deepest of the three (14 / 14 layers) and widest
hidden dims (encoder 768 / decoder 640). Takes a 16 kHz mono WAV and produces a
transcript. No translation, no multilingual capability, no timestamps.

## What it's for

English speech-to-text in both one-shot and streaming modes. The model takes a
16 kHz mono WAV and produces a transcript. It does not translate, has no
multilingual capability, and does not emit timestamps.

See Useful Sensors' [model card](https://huggingface.co/UsefulSensors/moonshine-streaming-medium)
for training data, intended use, and upstream evaluation methodology.

<!-- catalog:prose field=wer.notes -->
Greedy decoding (`num_beams=1`, `do_sample=False`). F32 reference baseline: 2.16%.
Quants are numerically indistinguishable from F32 on this manifest. Useful Sensors'
self-reported number on this split is 2.08% from the Open ASR Leaderboard table; the
+0.08pp residual matches the same scoring / text-normalization difference seen
across the tiny and small variants (cross-checked against HF Transformers on tiny
and found to be at 99.6% identical hypotheses to our port), and is not a numerical
drift. Q6_K / Q5_K_M / Q4_K_M GGUFs are not currently shipped for this variant.

**One utterance the model cannot end.** A single LibriSpeech test-clean clip —
`7176-92135-0020` (7.2 s; reference *"DOUBLE NINE TWO THREE ELSINORE DOUBLE NINE
YES HALLO IS THAT YOU HORATIO HAMLET SPEAKING"*) — drives the **medium** model
into a hallucination loop: it collapses the repeated digits into an endless run
of a single token and never emits end-of-stream. This is a property of the
upstream weights, **not the port** — the HF Transformers reference does the
identical thing (with `max_new_tokens` unbounded it emits an uninterrupted
stream of `9`s and never stops). The tiny and small variants terminate normally
on this clip; only medium loops. Our decoder bounds the runaway with a
duration-based generation budget (≈6.5 tokens per second of audio, plus a small
floor — matching the model card's recommended `max_new_tokens ≈ audio_seconds ×
6.5`), so the loop stops after a few dozen tokens instead of grinding to the
decoder's position cap. The utterance is flagged via
`transcribe_was_truncated()` and surfaced as an `output truncated` error
(non-zero exit); its incomplete transcript is counted as a miss in the 2.16%
WER above, so the baseline already includes this one pathological utterance.

Q6_K / Q5_K_M / Q4_K_M GGUFs are not currently shipped for this variant.

## Quick Start

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

build/bin/transcribe-cli \
  -m models/moonshine-streaming-medium/moonshine-streaming-medium-Q8_0.gguf \
  samples/jfk.wav
```

If your audio is not already 16 kHz mono WAV, convert it first:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ar 16000 -ac 1 output.wav
```

## Numerical Validation

transcribe.cpp is validated tensor-by-tensor against the HF Transformers
reference (`MoonshineStreamingForConditionalGeneration`, fp32 inference,
`attn_implementation="eager"`) on `samples/jfk.wav`. All contract tensors
fall within family tolerance, and the final transcript matches the
reference.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference | HF Transformers v5.7.0, `UsefulSensors/moonshine-streaming-medium` |
| Dump script | `scripts/dump_reference_moonshine_streaming_transformers.py` |
| Manifest | `tests/golden/moonshine_streaming/moonshine-streaming-medium.manifest.json` |
| Command | `uv run scripts/validate.py all --family moonshine_streaming --variant moonshine-streaming-medium` |

Tolerances are recorded at family scope in
`tests/tolerances/moonshine_streaming.json`. The dominant drift source is
BLAS reduction-order differences between PyTorch's matmul kernels and
ggml's `mul_mat`. Drift accumulates roughly linearly with depth across the
14-layer encoder, the adapter, and the 14-layer decoder; the family
tolerances were widened from the tiny baseline using
`max(1.5 × observed, prior, 1e-6)` to absorb the deeper-stack accumulation
without inflating the budget where it isn't needed. The final logit budget
remains well below 1e-3 absolute / 1e-4 mean.

Like the small variant, medium uses **non-square encoder attention**
(encoder residual dim 768, attention dim 640). The C++ port carries both
shapes through the encoder block.
