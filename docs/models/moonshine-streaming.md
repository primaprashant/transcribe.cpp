# Moonshine Streaming

Useful Sensors' Moonshine Streaming family ported to transcribe.cpp.
An English-only encoder-decoder transformer designed for streaming use:
ergodic encoder with sliding-window self-attention, 50 Hz time-domain
frontend (CMVN + asinh + linear + two causal stride-2 convs, no STFT),
and a learned-positional adapter between encoder and decoder. Distinct
from the non-streaming [Moonshine](moonshine.md) family — different
encoder, different frontend, different tokenizer hash, separate HF
`model_type`.

For the architecture deep-dive, validation contract, and porting notes,
see the family doc at
[`docs/porting/families/moonshine_streaming.md`](../porting/families/moonshine_streaming.md).

## Choosing a variant

- **Smallest footprint.** `moonshine-streaming-tiny` decodes well above
  realtime on Apple Silicon and Vulkan-class GPUs; CPU is also viable
  for live use.
- **Better accuracy, modest cost.** `moonshine-streaming-small` roughly
  halves WER vs tiny.
- **Best accuracy in the family.** `moonshine-streaming-medium` has the
  most accuracy headroom. Keep an eye on decode latency; the 14-layer
  decoder dominates wall time on long utterances.
- **Non-streaming, batch-only workloads.** Use the
  [`moonshine`](moonshine.md) family instead — it's smaller for the
  same WER on offline audio because it doesn't carry the streaming
  encoder's sliding-window machinery.
- **Non-English audio.** Not supported on this family (English-only,
  no language detection, no translation).

> **Streaming runtime status.** Real-time streaming is implemented and
> validated. Feed audio incrementally through the
> `transcribe_stream_begin` / `transcribe_stream_feed` /
> `transcribe_stream_finalize` API (CLI: `--stream-chunk-ms`), or run a
> single one-shot pass over the full encoder for offline transcription.
> The streaming path uses ~240 ms cumulative encoder right-context, an
> 80 ms feed cadence, and a 20 ms natural emit unit.

## All variants

WER is on LibriSpeech test-clean for the **Q8_0** preset, measured by
transcribe.cpp's WER pipeline with greedy decode (`num_beams=1`,
`do_sample=False`). See each per-variant doc for the full F32 / F16 /
Q8_0 matrix and the comparison to Useful Sensors' Open ASR Leaderboard
numbers — across the family, our F32 and Q8_0 land within 0.1pp of the
HF reference scored on the same manifest, and the small residual to the
upstream-reported numbers is a scoring / text-normalization difference,
not a numerical drift in the port. The K-tier presets (Q6_K / Q5_K_M /
Q4_K_M) are not currently shipped for this family.

Pre-built GGUFs for every variant and quant are hosted under
[`handy-computer` on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/handy-computer);
each per-variant doc has direct download links.

## Input limits

No input-length limit, but the decoder is capped at its output window — about
**17 minutes** of typical speech (a 4,096-token decode window, shared across
variants). Offline, a transcript that reaches the cap is returned with
`TRANSCRIBE_ERR_OUTPUT_TRUNCATED` (partial text retained); when streaming, the
stream keeps its committed text and sets `transcribe_was_truncated()` while
finalize still returns OK. See the [input-length contract](../input-limits.md).

## Quick start

Pick a variant and run:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

build/bin/transcribe-cli \
  -m models/moonshine-streaming-tiny/moonshine-streaming-tiny-Q8_0.gguf \
  samples/jfk.wav
```

The repo doesn't ship the GGUFs — pull them from the corresponding
`handy-computer/<variant>-gguf` repo on Hugging Face, or convert from
the upstream Useful Sensors checkpoint via the per-variant doc's
reproduction section.

## Capabilities

All Moonshine Streaming variants support:

- **Transcription** of 16 kHz mono WAV input directly from raw PCM
  through the time-domain frontend.
- **Single-utterance (one-shot) decode** for offline audio.
- **Real-time streaming** via `transcribe_stream_begin` /
  `transcribe_stream_feed` / `transcribe_stream_finalize` (CLI:
  `--stream-chunk-ms`) — ~240 ms cumulative encoder right-context, 80 ms
  feed cadence, 20 ms natural emit unit.

What's not supported (consistent across the family): translation,
language detection, multilingual transcription (English only),
timestamps, VAD, speaker diarization. See the family doc for the full
runtime contract.
